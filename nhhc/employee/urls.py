Modeule: employee.urls
This module contains the URL patterns for the employee management application.


The URL patterns include:
- employee_details: Retrieves details of a specific employee
- reject-application: Allows for the rejection of an application with CSRF exemption
- employee_roster: Displays the roster of employees
- hire-employee: Handles the hiring of new employees

These URL patterns are used to define the routing for the views in the application.
